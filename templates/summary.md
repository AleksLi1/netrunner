## File Template

```markdown

phase: XX-name
plan: YY
subsystem: [primary category: auth, payments, ui, api, database, infra, testing, etc.]
tags: [searchable tech: jwt, stripe, react, postgres, prisma]

# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: [prior phase this depends on]
    provides: [what that phase built that this uses]
provides:
  - [bullet list of what this phase built/delivered]
affects: [list of phase names or keywords that will need this context]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: [libraries/tools added in this phase]
  patterns: [architectural/code patterns established]

key-files:
  created: [important files created]
  modified: [important files modified]

key-decisions:
  - "Decision 1"
  - "Decision 2"

# Phase [X]: [Name] Summary

**[Substantive one-liner describing outcome - NOT "phase complete" or "implementation finished"]**

## Performance

- **Duration:** [time] (e.g., 23 min, 1h 15m)
- **Started:** [ISO timestamp]
- **Completed:** [ISO timestamp]
- **Tasks:** [count completed]
- **Files modified:** [count]

## Accomplishments
- [Most important outcome]
- [Second key accomplishment]
- [Third if applicable]

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: [task name]** - `abc123f` (feat/fix/test/refactor)
2. **Task 2: [task name]** - `def456g` (feat/fix/test/refactor)
3. **Task 3: [task name]** - `hij789k` (feat/fix/test/refactor)

**Plan metadata:** `lmn012o` (docs: complete plan)

_Note: TDD tasks may have multiple commits (test -> feat -> refactor)_

## Files Created/Modified
- `path/to/file.ts` - What it does
- `path/to/another.ts` - What it does

## Decisions Made
[Key decisions with brief rationale, or "None - followed plan as specified"]

## Deviations from Plan

[If no deviations: "None - plan executed exactly as written"]

[If deviations occurred:]

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule X - Category] Brief description**
- **Found during:** Task [N] ([task name])
- **Issue:** [What was wrong]
- **Fix:** [What was done]
- **Files modified:** [file paths]
- **Verification:** [How it was verified]
- **Committed in:** [hash] (part of task commit)

---

**Total deviations:** [N] auto-fixed ([breakdown by rule])
**Impact on plan:** [Brief assessment]

## User Setup Required

[If USER-SETUP.md was generated:]
See `{phase}-USER-SETUP.md` (status: Incomplete/Complete/Not needed) for:
- Environment variables to add
- Dashboard configuration steps
- Verification commands

[If no USER-SETUP.md:]
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
[What's ready for next phase]
[Any blockers or concerns]

<frontmatter_guidance>
**Purpose:** Enable automatic context assembly via dependency graph. Frontmatter makes summary metadata machine-readable for the brain and downstream agents.

**Key-files:** Important files for @context references in PLAN.md.

**Patterns:** Established conventions future phases should maintain.

**Population:** Frontmatter is populated during summary creation in execute-plan.md. See `<step name="create_summary">` for field-by-field guidance.
</frontmatter_guidance>

<one_liner_rules>
The one-liner MUST be substantive:

**Good:**
- "JWT auth with refresh rotation using jose library"
- "Prisma schema with User, Session, and Product models"
- "Dashboard with real-time metrics via Server-Sent Events"

**Bad:**
- "Phase complete"
- "Authentication implemented"
- "Foundation finished"
- "All tasks done"

The one-liner should tell someone what actually shipped.
</one_liner_rules>

<guidelines>
**Frontmatter:** MANDATORY - complete all fields. Enables automatic context assembly for future planning.

**One-liner:** Must be substantive. Tells someone scanning summaries what actually shipped in this plan.

**Task Commits:** Record every commit hash. This is the audit trail from plan to code.

**Deviations:** Document any auto-fixes. These inform the brain about unexpected issues and improve future planning.

**Next Phase Readiness:** Critical for the brain's transition reasoning. Flag blockers here.
</guidelines>
